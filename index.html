        <h1>Big News: Making a Website for the First Time in a WHILE</h1>
        <p class="text">Let's not think about how long it's been.
            <i>(It was middle school.)</i> But we're <b>not thinking about it.</b>
        </p>
        </div>
        <p id="listintro">Some better things to think about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Free food</li>
            <li>Why JavaScript is so bad</li>
            <li>How much homework I have to do this weekend</li>
            <li>Maybe not that last one</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
        <a id=link href="https://hackrpi.com">
            Here's the reason I've returned to the wonderful world of website making. 
        </a>
        </div>
        <img id="death" src="discworlddeath.jpg" 
        alt="Discworld Death because he's also worth thinking about" />
        <p class="text">To be clear, I haven't picked up making websites again because of the 
            personification of death in hit fantasy series Discworld. It would be
            funny if I did, but unfortunately the reason is the somewhat more boring
            HackRPI event.
